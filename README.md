Hobby project for the backend of a self hosted application similar to [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/) or [The Story Graph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) but with a more limited scope.
The main idea is to keep a track of what I read, but without the adds or the clunky UI. ( My UI is also clunky, but i know how it works since i designed it).
